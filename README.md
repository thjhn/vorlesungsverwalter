VorlesungsVerwalter
===================
A web-based system to administer grades of students in an university course.

(This project is in an early development stage; be careful when using it with real data.)

Objective
---------
This project is developed with the following scenario in mind:
 1.  Students enroll to your lecture by enrolling into one exercise classes.
 2.  Students submit (on paper) their solutions to excercise sheets. Their submissions are then graded by your correctors.
 3.  The correctors store the grades given using VorlesungsVerwalter.
 4.  Also grades in exams are managed in a similar manner.
 
We aim at meeting the following requirements:
 * We store all data in local files. There is no need for any database. This allows TAs to run this project on their personal homepage.
 * The data of the students stored in this files is encrypted.

Installation
------------
Run the install.php file in your browser and make sure you resolve the errors shown (if any). Then you should be able to provide some information about your lecture and hit submit.

First Steps
-----------
When you have set-up the program you may log in.
  1. You should start by creating an exercise group such that students can enroll.
  2. Then you should allow students to really enroll by adding a "Anmeldezeitraum".
  3. After that you may want to add new users aka correctors.
  
Limitations
-----------
As said before: This project is in an early development stage; be careful when using it with real data.
 * Currently, the GUI is in german only.
 * The GUI is not "smartphone friendly".
 * Managing exams is currently not possible.
